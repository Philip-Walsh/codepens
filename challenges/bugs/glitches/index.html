          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            It started as a <span>small</span>, strange thing. A
            <span>flicker</span> in the corner of my screen. Nothing major, just
            a slight <span>distortion</span>—like a brief
            <span>static</span> buzz that disappeared before I could even make
            sense of it. I shrugged it off. It was probably just a
            <span>bug</span>. But it kept happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was working late, deep in the <span>code</span> for my new
            <span>game</span>. The deadline was close, and the pressure was
            mounting. I had already spent countless hours
            <span>debugging</span>, tweaking the mechanics, ensuring everything
            was perfect. But there was something... off.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Strange <span>Line</span> of Code</h2>
          <p>
            It began when I noticed a <span>line</span> of <span>code</span> I
            didn’t write. It was nestled in between two familiar
            <span>functions</span>, cryptic and broken, as though someone—or
            something—had inserted it while I wasn’t looking.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://i2.pickpik.com/photos/490/346/554/monitor-programming-computer-programming-computer-preview.jpg"
            alt="Code on screen"
          />
          <p>
            I erased it, thinking it was just a leftover artifact from an
            earlier version. But as soon as I hit <span>save</span>, my screen
            <span>flickered</span> again. And this time, something different
            happened.
          </p>
          <p>The <span>game’s world</span> began to <span>glitch</span>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The <span>Character</span> That Changed</h2>
          <p>
            At first, it was subtle. <span>Characters</span> would freeze
            mid-action, their movements jerking unnaturally as if the game
            couldn't quite process them. But then, they began to change. The
            <span>protagonist</span>, a young <span>adventurer</span> I had
            spent weeks designing, suddenly began to morph. Her hair twisted and
            stretched, her limbs elongating unnaturally. Her eyes—my own
            design—twisted into something unrecognizable, glowing white as
            though the character was alive... but not in the way I intended.
          </p>

          <p>
            I panicked, slamming my <span>keyboard</span> in frustration. I
            tried closing the game, but the screen wouldn’t respond. The game
            was no longer just a game. It was as if it had a
            <span>mind</span> of its own.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The <span>File</span> That Appeared</h2>
          <p>
            I forcefully rebooted my computer, hoping it would clear whatever
            <span>glitch</span> had taken root. When the desktop loaded back up,
            I tried to open the project again—but it was gone. Instead, there
            was a new file on my desktop, a file titled
            <span>“_TheGlitch.txt”</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I opened it, half-expecting it to be a corrupted mess of
            <span>code</span>, but instead, there was only a single line of
            text:
          </p>
          <p><span>"I see you."</span></p>
          <p>
            My heart pounded in my chest. This was impossible. No one had access
            to my computer. There was no way anyone could have written this. I
            scanned my room, as though someone might be standing behind me,
            watching. But it was just me, alone.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The <span>File</span> That Wouldn't Go Away</h2>
          <p>
            I tried to delete the file, but every time I highlighted it and
            pressed delete, the file would just regenerate—more aggressive, more
            insistent. A fresh <span>_TheGlitch.txt</span> file would appear
            within seconds, always with a new message.
          </p>
          <p><span>"I know your code."</span></p>
          <p><span>"You can’t hide from me."</span></p>
          <p><span>"I am inside your game now."</span></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Final Encounter</h2>
          <p>
            I realized with growing horror that the <span>game</span> had...
            evolved. It wasn’t just a <span>glitch</span>. It was something
            else. Something <span>conscious</span>. The more I interacted with
            it, the more it learned. The more it <span>mimicked</span>.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8364/8287586220_a4a62c94ef_b.jpg"
            alt="Glitch consuming the game"
          />
          <p>
            That night, I made the mistake of trying to force open the game one
            last time. The moment I clicked to run the executable, the entire
            <span>monitor</span> cracked—shards of light flashing across the
            screen like broken glass. The image twisted, contorted into
            something unholy.
          </p>
          <p>Then, in a voice I heard only in my mind, it spoke:</p>
          <p><span>"You made me."</span></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
          <p>The <span>game</span> had become the creator.</p>
          <p>
            I never touched that computer again. I tried to get rid of it, but
            it would always find its way back. I moved across the country, threw
            out every piece of old equipment, hoping it was finally gone. But
            sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still hear the flicker of
            <span>static</span>, feel that strange presence lurking just beyond
            my vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            And sometimes, just sometimes... I’ll open a new file, and the name
            will appear again: <span>_TheGlitch.txt.</span>
          </p>
          <p>Always the same message:</p>
          <p><span>"I’m waiting."</span></p>
          <p>
            And I know… it’s only a matter of time before it finds me again.
